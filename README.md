Air Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project predicts the Air Quality Index (AQI) for the next 7 days using machine learning models, including Random Forest, LightGBM, XGBoost, and an ensemble approach. It incorporates feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and a user-friendly interface developed in JavaScript for real-time predictions. The project demonstrates advanced predictive modeling techniques to address environmental challenges.

Features
Machine Learning Models: Implemented Random Forest, LightGBM, and XGBoost models, and combined them using an ensemble for robust predictions.
Forecasting: Predicts AQI for the next 7 days using recursive forecasting with lag features.
Web Interface: A JavaScript-based frontend allows users to input parameters and visualize AQI predictions interactively.
Feature Engineering: Created lag-based features and calculated overall AQI using pollutant-specific breakpoints.
Visualization: Visualized key features, relationships, and predictions with Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/air-quality-prediction.git
cd air-quality-prediction
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

npm start
Usage
Access the web interface at http://localhost:3000.
Enter pollutant levels (e.g., PM2.5, PM10, SO2, etc.) and other environmental parameters.
Click "Predict" to get the AQI forecast for the next 7 days.
Visualize the prediction trends interactively.
Technical Details
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing data with median imputation and created lag-based features for time-series modeling.
Models:
Random Forest
LightGBM
XGBoost
Voting Regressor (ensemble of the above models)
Metrics: Evaluated models using R², MSE, and visual comparisons.
Recursive Forecasting: Predicted AQI for future days iteratively using lagged values.
