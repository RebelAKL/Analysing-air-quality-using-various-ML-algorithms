---

### **Project Overview**
The AQI Forecasting and Prediction project is designed to analyze air quality parameters and predict the AQI using machine learning models. This application also allows users to input air quality data manually and provides a calculated AQI based on standard pollutant-specific formulas. The platform forecasts AQI for up to seven days and presents results through an interactive and user-friendly interface.

### **Key Features**
1. **Manual Input of Air Quality Parameters:**
   - Users can manually input values for pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, NO, NO2, NOx, NH3, SO2, CO, Benzene, Toluene, and meteorological parameters.
   - Provides both model-predicted AQI and manually calculated AQI using pollutant-specific breakpoints.

2. **Forecasting AQI for the Next 7 Days:**
   - Uses trained machine learning models to predict AQI for future days.
   - Generates realistic forecasts based on current and historical air quality data.

3. **Visualization:**
   - Displays individual pollutant AQI contributions.
   - Presents forecasted AQI trends in tabular and graphical formats for better analysis.

4. **Interactive Streamlit Application:**
   - A web-based interface to facilitate easy interaction and data visualization.

### **Working of the Application**
#### **Data Input**
- Users provide air quality parameter data either manually or through an automated dataset.
- Parameters include pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO, NO2, NOx, NH3, SO2, CO, Benzene, Toluene) and meteorological factors (RH, WS, WD, SR, BP, AT).

#### **Processing**
- Input data is scaled using a pre-trained `StandardScaler` from Scikit-learn.
- Features are ordered as per the modelâ€™s training schema to ensure consistency.

#### **AQI Calculation**
1. **Manual AQI Calculation:**
   - Breakpoints for pollutants are used to calculate individual AQI values.
   - The overall AQI is determined as the maximum value among the pollutant-specific AQI values.
2. **Model Prediction:**
   - Scaled input data is fed into the pre-trained regression model to predict the AQI.

#### **Forecasting**
- The trained model predicts AQI for the next 7 days based on simulated fluctuations in pollutant levels.

#### **Output**
- Displays the predicted AQI (model) and calculated AQI (manual).
- Provides a forecast for AQI trends in the next 7 days.
- Outputs individual pollutant AQI contributions for better understanding.
